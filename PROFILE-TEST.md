# 🖼️ Profile Image Test Guide

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Corrected Image Filename**: Changed from `profile-photo.jpg` to `profile-photo.jpg.jpg` (your actual file name)
2. **Removed Unused Placeholder**: Cleaned up references to non-existent SVG file
3. **Enhanced CSS**: Added `!important` rules to ensure image visibility
4. **Improved JavaScript**: Added better debugging and image loading handling

## 🔍 **How to Test:**

### **Step 1: Refresh Your Browser**
1. **Open** your `index.html` file in your web browser
2. **Press F5** or **Ctrl+F5** to refresh the page
3. **Check the console** (F12 → Console tab) for any error messages

### **Step 2: Check Profile Image**
You should now see:
- ✅ **Your profile photo** displayed prominently at the top
- ✅ **Smooth entrance animation** when the page loads
- ✅ **Professional styling** with rounded corners and shadows
- ✅ **Hover effects** when you move your mouse over it

### **Step 3: If Image Still Doesn't Show**
1. **Check Console**: Look for any error messages
2. **Verify File**: Make sure `profile-photo.jpg.jpg` is in the same folder as `index.html`
3. **File Size**: Your image is 182KB, which should load fine
4. **Browser Cache**: Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**
- **Profile Image**: Your beautiful photo should be visible at the top
- **Size**: 350x450 pixels on desktop, responsive on mobile
- **Position**: Above your name and title
- **Styling**: Rounded corners, shadow, and hover effects

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working:**
1. **Check file permissions**
2. **Try a different browser**
3. **Verify the image file isn't corrupted**
4. **Check if any ad-blockers are interfering**

## 💡 **Quick Fix:**
If the image still doesn't show, the fallback will display:
- Beautiful gradient background
- Your initials "MB"
- Your full name "Mangalarapu Byula"

Your profile image should now be working perfectly! 🎉
